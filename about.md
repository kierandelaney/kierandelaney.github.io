I am a 30-something Director of IT living in North Yorkshire. I enjoy building things. I enjoy breaking things. I enjoy discovering how things work.

I enjoy cycling, both on road and off road and I enjoy walking outdoors, preferably up big things.

I love music.

I have a son who makes me laugh every day.
